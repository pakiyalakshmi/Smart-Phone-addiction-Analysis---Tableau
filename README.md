Introduction
Smartphone addiction has become a pervasive issue impacting mental and physical well-being. Through this project, we leverage Tableau to explore data and uncover patterns in smartphone usage behavior.

Project Objectives
Understand the extent of smartphone addiction through data analysis.
Highlight usage trends across different age groups, demographics, and time periods.
Identify factors contributing to excessive screen time.
Propose actionable recommendations to minimize smartphone overuse.
Dataset Overview
Source: (Specify your data source, e.g., Kaggle, Survey Data, or any specific dataset)
Features: The dataset includes the following key columns:
User demographics (age, gender, location)
Daily screen time (hours)
App usage breakdown (social media, gaming, etc.)
Sleep patterns
Productivity impact scores
Key Features
Interactive Dashboards: Intuitive dashboards for exploring data.
Customizable Filters: Filters for demographics, app usage, and time periods.
Trend Analysis: Year-over-year and day-to-day trend comparisons.
Correlations: Analysis of relationships between screen time and productivity/sleep.
Visualizations
The following visualizations are included in the project:

Screen Time Distribution: A bar chart displaying daily screen time across user groups.
App Usage Breakdown: A pie chart showing the percentage of time spent on various apps.
Heatmap of Productivity vs. Screen Time: An interactive heatmap analyzing productivity loss due to increased screen time.
Sleep Patterns vs. Smartphone Usage: A line chart correlating sleep duration and smartphone usage.
Trend Dashboard: A dashboard showing trends in screen time over months and years.
Insights and Recommendations
Excessive smartphone use is most prevalent among users aged 18â€“25.
Social media accounts for the highest percentage of screen time, followed by gaming.
Increased screen time is negatively correlated with productivity and sleep quality.
Recommendations:
Implement "focus mode" features to limit app usage during work hours.
Encourage digital detox programs through awareness campaigns.
Advocate for better time management practices via apps and training.
How to Use
Install Tableau Desktop or use Tableau Public.
Download the Tableau workbook file (smartphone_addiction_analysis.twb or .twbx).
Open the file in Tableau and explore the dashboards interactively.
Use filters to customize the data view as per your requirements.
Future Enhancements
Integration of real-time data from smartphone usage APIs.
Addition of predictive analytics to forecast addiction trends.
Conduct a deeper dive into the impact of specific apps on mental health.
